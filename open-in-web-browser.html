          <section class="sub">
            <p>
              This section provides an overview of the field of front-end
              development / engineering.
            </p>
          </section>
          <h3>1.1 &mdash; What is a (Frontend||UI||UX) Developer/Engineer?</h3>
          <p>
            A front-end developer/engineer uses Web Platform
            Technologies&mdash;namely HTML, CSS, and JavaScript&mdash; to
            produce a front-end (i.e., a user interface with which the user
            interacts) for websites, web applications, and native applications.
          </p>

          <p>
            Most practitioners are introduced to the occupation after creating
            their first HTML web page. The most straightforward and simplest
            work output from a front-end developer/engineer is an HTML document
            that runs in a web browser, producing a web page.
          </p>

          <h4>Additional Outputs:</h4>

            <li>
              <p>
                <strong>Websites</strong> - A website is a collection of
                interlinked web pages and associated multimedia content
                accessible over the Internet. Typically identified by a unique
                domain name, a website is hosted on web servers and can be
                accessed by users through a web browser. Websites serve various
                functions ranging from simple static web pages to complex
                dynamic web pages.

              <p>
                <strong>The front-end of a Web Application</strong> - Unlike
                native applications installed on a device, web applications are
                delivered to users through a web browser. They often interact
                with databases to store, retrieve, and manipulate data. Because
                web applications run in a browser, they are generally
                cross-platform and can be accessed on various devices, including
                desktops, laptops, tablets, and smartphones.
              </p>
            </li>

                  Technologies)</strong
                >
                - These applications are built from web technologies and
                typically use native APIs and device features like those made
                with traditional native development frameworks (e.g., file
                system API). This type of development can be accomplished using
                an embedded webview (e.g., Tauri), browser engine (e.g.,
                Electron), or be as complex as compiling web technologies
                directly into native application code (e.g., React Native,
                NativeScript, Flutter, etc.).

              <strong>The Front-end Divide:</strong> The
              <a href="https://css-tricks.com/the-great-divide/"
                >"The Great Divide"</a
              >
              in front-end web development describes a growing split between two
              main groups: JavaScript-centric programmers, who focus on
              frameworks and complex programming for web applications, and
              HTML/CSS-centric developers, who specialize in UI interactions,
              accessibility, and the structural aspects of web pages and
              websites. The reality is that this divide exists between computer
              science-focused software engineers, who prioritize web programming
              skills required to build web software applications and engage in
              front-end development, and those who come to front-end development
              from the design side, typically as self-taught programmers. The
              fact is, to be a front-end developer, you need to be a mix of
              both, with the degree of mixing being subjective. However, in
              2024, it's clear that the job market heavily favors the
              JavaScript-centric programmer, skilled in areas like JavaScript,
              Terminal/CLI, Node.js, Databases, Web Data APIs, TypeScript, GIT,
              Testing, CI/CD, Software Principles, Programming Principles, etc.

              <strong>Keeping Up with Technologies:</strong> Frontend
              development is a rapidly evolving field. Developers must
              continuously learn and adapt to new technologies, frameworks, and
              best practices. Staying updated requires constant effort.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Web Runtime Support:</strong> Ensuring that web
              technologies work consistently across various web platform run
              times (e.g., web browsers and webviews) while not as complicated
              and challenging as it once was, can still require significant
              effort and skill.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Responsive Design &amp; Adaptive Design:</strong> Frontend
              developers must create UI's that work on a wide range of devices,
              from desktop computers to smartphones. This requires a deep
              understanding of responsive design and adaptive design principles.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Performance Optimization:</strong> Developers need to
              ensure that websites are not only functional but also fast and
              efficient. This involves optimizing images, minifying CSS and
              JavaScript, and understanding how to leverage browser caching.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Understanding UX Principles &amp; UI Patterns:</strong> A
              strong understanding of UI interaction's is crucial. Developers
              must often collaborate with designers who lack interaction design
              skills, and it is up to the developer to create user centered
              UI's.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Accessibility:</strong> Building web sites and
              applications that are accessible to all users, including those
              with disabilities, is both a legal and ethical requirement. This
              means understanding and implementing web accessibility standards.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Code Maintenance and Scalability:</strong> Writing clean,
              maintainable, and scalable code is essential for long-term project
              success. This often involves adhering to coding standards and best
              practices.

          <h3>4.3 &mdash; IP Addresses</h3>
          <p>
            IP Addresses serve as unique identifiers for devices on the
            internet, similar to how a postal address identifies a location in
            the physical world. They are critical for the accurate routing and
            delivery of data across the internet. Each device connected to the
            internet, from computers to smartphones, is assigned an IP address.
          </p>

          <p>There are two main types of IP address standards:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>IPv4 (Internet Protocol version 4)</strong>: This is the
              older and most widely used standard. IPv4 addresses are 32 bits in
              length, allowing for a theoretical maximum of about 4.3 billion
              unique addresses. They are typically represented in decimal
              format, divided into four octets (e.g., 192.0.2.1).
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>IPv6 (Internet Protocol version 6)</strong>: With the
              rapid growth of the internet and the exhaustion of IPv4 addresses,
              IPv6 was introduced. IPv6 addresses are 128 bits long, greatly
              expanding the number of available addresses. They are expressed in
              hexadecimal format, separated by colons (e.g.,
              2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334). This standard not only
              addresses the limitation of available addresses but also improves
              upon various aspects of IP addressing, including simplified
              processing by routers and enhanced security features.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            Both IP address standards are essential in the current landscape of
            the internet. While IPv4 is still predominant, the transition to
            IPv6 is gradually taking place as the need for more internet
            addresses continues to grow, driven by the proliferation of
            internet-connected devices.
          </p>

          <h3>4.4 &mdash; DNS (Domain Name System)</h3>
          <p>
            The Domain Name System (DNS) is the internet's equivalent of a phone
            book. It translates user-friendly domain names (like
            www.example.com) into IP addresses that computers use. DNS is
            crucial for the user-friendly navigation of the internet, allowing
            users to access websites without needing to memorize complex
            numerical IP addresses.

          <h3>4.5 &mdash; Servers and Server Hosting</h3>
          <p>
            Servers are powerful computers specifically designed to process
            requests and deliver data to other computers over the internet or a
            local network. Server hosting refers to the provision of server
            resources and internet connectivity to host websites, applications,
            and services. Hosting can range from shared servers, where multiple
            clients share resources, to dedicated servers for individual
            clients.
          </p>

          <h3>4.6 &mdash; CDN (Content Delivery Network)</h3>
          <p>
            A Content Delivery Network (CDN) is a geographically distributed
            network of servers that work together to provide fast delivery of
            internet content. By storing copies of content at multiple,
            strategically located servers, CDNs reduce latency and improve
            access speed, particularly for high-traffic websites and global
            services.
          </p>

          <h3>4.7 &mdash; URLs (Uniform Resource Locators)</h3>
          <p>
            Uniform Resource Locators (URLs) are the addresses used to access
            resources on the internet. A URL specifies the location of a
            resource on a server and the protocol used to access it. It
            typically includes a protocol (like HTTP or HTTPS), a domain name,
            and a path to the resource.

          <h3>4.8 &mdash; Web Browsers</h3>
          <p>
            Web browsers are sophisticated software applications that play a
            crucial role in accessing and interacting with the World Wide Web.
            They serve as the interface between users and web content, rendering
            web pages and providing a seamless user experience. Here's a deeper
            look into their functionality and features:
          </p>

          <p>Core Functions of Web Browsers:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Rendering Web Content:</strong> Browsers interpret and
              display content written in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. They process
              HTML for structure, CSS for presentation, and JavaScript for
              interactivity, converting them into the visual and interactive web
              pages.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Request and Response Cycle:</strong> When a user requests
              a webpage, the browser sends this request to the server where the
              page is hosted. The server responds with the necessary files
              (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, images, etc.), which the browser then
              processes to render the page.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Executing JavaScript:</strong> Modern browsers come with
              JavaScript engines that execute JavaScript code, enabling dynamic
              interactions on web pages, such as form validations, animations,
              and asynchronous data fetching.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p>How Browsers Work Behind the Scenes:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Parsing:</strong> Browsers parse HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
              files to understand the structure, style, and behavior of the
              webpage.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Rendering Engine:</strong> Each browser has a rendering
              engine that translates web content into what users see on their
              screen. This includes layout calculations, style computations, and
              painting the final visual output.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Optimization:</strong> Modern browsers optimize
              performance through techniques like caching (storing copies of
              frequently accessed resources) and lazy loading (loading
              non-critical resources only when needed).
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p>The Role of Browsers in Web Development:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Cross-browser Compatibility:</strong> Developers must
              ensure that websites function correctly across different browsers,
              each with its quirks and rendering behaviors.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Responsive Design:</strong> Browsers enable responsive
              design, allowing websites to adapt their layout and functionality
              to different screen sizes and devices.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Accessibility:</strong> They provide features that assist
              in making web content accessible to all users, including those
              with disabilities.

          <h3>4.9 &mdash; JavaScript Engines</h3>
          <p>
            JavaScript engines are specialized software components designed to
            process, compile, and execute JavaScript code. JavaScript, being a
            high-level, interpreted scripting language, requires an engine to
            convert it into executable code that a computer can understand.
            These engines are not just a part of web browsers but are also used
            in other contexts, like servers (Node.js uses the V8 engine).
          </p>

          <p>Key Functions of JavaScript Engines:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Parsing</strong>: The engine reads the raw JavaScript
              code, breaking it down into elements it can understand (tokens)
              and constructing a structure (Abstract Syntax Tree - AST) that
              represents the program's syntactic structure.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Compilation</strong>: Modern JavaScript engines use a
              technique called Just-In-Time (JIT) compilation. This process
              involves two stages in many engines:
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Baseline Compilation: Converts JavaScript into a simpler
                  intermediate code quickly.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Optimizing Compilation: Further compiles the code to a more
                  optimized machine code, improving performance. The engine
                  might de-optimize the code if certain assumptions are no
                  longer valid.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Execution</strong>: The compiled code is executed by the
              computer's processor.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Optimization</strong>: During execution, the engine
              collects data to optimize the code's performance in real-time,
              often recompiling it for greater efficiency.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p>Major JavaScript Engines:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>V8 (Google Chrome, Node.js)</strong>: Known for its speed
              and efficiency, V8 compiles JavaScript directly to native machine
              code before executing it.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>SpiderMonkey (Mozilla Firefox)</strong>: The first-ever
              JavaScript engine, it has evolved significantly, focusing on
              performance and scalability.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>JavaScriptCore (Safari)</strong>: Also known as Nitro, it
              emphasizes efficient execution.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Chakra (Formerly in Microsoft Edge)</strong>: Before Edge
              moved to Chromium, Chakra was its engine, known for its concurrent
              JIT compilation.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h3>4.10 &mdash; HTTP/HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol/Secure)</h3>
          <p>
            HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol) and HTTPS (HTTP Secure) are
            foundational protocols used for the transfer of information on the
            internet. HTTP forms the basis of data communication on the World
            Wide Web, whereas HTTPS adds a layer of security to this
            communication.
          </p>

          <p>Key Aspects of HTTP and HTTPS:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Basic Function:</strong> HTTP is designed to enable
              communication between web browsers and servers. It follows a
              request-response structure where the browser requests data, and
              the server responds with the requested information.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Security with HTTPS:</strong> HTTPS is essentially HTTP
              with encryption. It uses SSL/TLS protocols to encrypt the data
              transferred between the browser and the server, enhancing security
              and protecting sensitive information from interception or
              tampering.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Port Numbers:</strong> By default, HTTP uses port 80 and
              HTTPS uses port 443. These ports are used by web servers to listen
              for incoming connections from web clients.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>URL Structure:</strong> In URLs, HTTP is indicated by
              'http://' while HTTPS is indicated by 'https://'. This small
              difference in the URL signifies whether the connection to the
              website is secured with encryption or not.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p>Differences and Usage:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Data Security:</strong> The most significant difference is
              security. HTTPS provides a secure channel, especially important
              for websites handling sensitive data like banking, shopping, or
              personal information.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>SEO and Trust:</strong> Search engines like Google give
              preference to HTTPS websites, considering them more secure. Also,
              web browsers often display security warnings for HTTP sites,
              affecting user trust.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Certificate Requirements:</strong> To implement HTTPS, a
              website must obtain an SSL/TLS certificate from a recognized
              Certificate Authority (CA). This certificate is crucial for
              establishing a trusted and encrypted connection.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Performance:</strong> While HTTPS used to be slower than
              HTTP due to the encryption process, advancements in technology
              have significantly reduced this performance gap.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            Understanding the differences between HTTP and HTTPS is crucial for
            web developers and users alike. The choice between them can
            significantly impact website security, user trust, and search engine
            ranking.

          <h3>4.11 &mdash; Web Sockets</h3>
          <p>
            WebSockets represent a significant advancement in web technologies,
            enabling real-time, bi-directional communication between a user's
            browser and a server. This technology allows for an interactive
            communication session where both the client (user's browser) and the
            server can send data directly to each other, creating opportunities
            for more dynamic and responsive web applications.
          </p>

          <p>Key Features of WebSockets:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Persistent Connection:</strong> Unlike traditional HTTP
              connections, which are stateless and closed after a data transfer
              is complete, a WebSocket connection remains open, facilitating
              ongoing data exchange. This persistent connection allows for
              faster interactions since the overhead of re-establishing a
              connection for each data transfer is eliminated.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Full Duplex Communication:</strong> WebSockets provide a
              full duplex channel, meaning data can be sent and received
              simultaneously. This is a significant improvement over HTTP, where
              communication is typically uni-directional with each
              request-response cycle.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Reduced Overhead:</strong> After the initial handshake
              over HTTP, data is transferred over a single socket, reducing the
              overhead associated with HTTP headers and allowing for more
              efficient communication, especially beneficial for applications
              that require frequent small messages, like chat systems or live
              sports updates.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Compatibility with Existing Infrastructure:</strong>
              WebSockets operate over the standard port 80 for HTTP and port 443
              for HTTPS, making them compatible with existing internet
              infrastructure, including firewalls and proxies.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Real-Time Applications:</strong> This technology is
              particularly well-suited for applications that require real-time
              updates, such as online gaming, chat applications, and financial
              trading platforms.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            By leveraging WebSockets, developers can create more interactive and
            responsive web experiences, significantly enhancing the capabilities

          <h3>4.12 &mdash; Domain Registration</h3>
          <p>
            Domain registration is the process of acquiring a domain name from a
            domain registrar (e.g., GoDaddy). Domain names serve as an
            easy-to-remember alias for numerical IP addresses, allowing users to
            find websites easily. This process is essential for establishing an
            online presence, as it not only secures a unique domain name but
            also often includes services like hosting and email.

          <h3>5.1 &mdash; HyperText Markup Language (HTML)</h3>

          <p>
            HTML, which stands for HyperText Markup Language, is the standard
            language used to create and design web pages. It's not a programming
            language like JavaScript; instead, it's a markup language that
            defines the structure and layout of a web page.
          </p>

          <p>Here's a basic breakdown of how HTML works:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Elements and Tags:</strong> HTML uses 'elements' to define
              different parts of a web page. Each element is enclosed in 'tags',
              which are written in angle brackets. For example, &lt;p&gt; is the
              opening tag for a paragraph and &lt;/p&gt; is the closing tag. The
              content goes between these tags.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Structure of a Document:</strong> An HTML document has a
              defined structure with a head (&lt;head&gt;) and a body
              (&lt;body&gt;). The head contains meta-information like the title
              of the page, while the body contains the actual content that's
              visible to users.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Hierarchy and Nesting:</strong> Elements can be nested
              within each other to create a hierarchy. This nesting helps in
              organizing the content and defines parent-child relationships
              between elements.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Attributes:</strong> Elements can have attributes that
              provide additional information about them. For example, the href
              attribute in an anchor (link) element (&lt;a&gt;) specifies the
              URL the link goes to.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Common Elements:</strong> Some common HTML elements
              include:
              <ul>
                <li>
                  &lt;h1&gt; to &lt;h6&gt;: Heading elements, with &lt;h1&gt;
                  being the highest level.
                </li>
                <li>&lt;p&gt;: Paragraph element.</li>
                <li>&lt;a&gt;: Anchor element for links.</li>
                <li>&lt;img&gt;: Image element.</li>
                <li>
                  &lt;ul&gt;, &lt;ol&gt;, &lt;li&gt;: Unordered (bullets) and
                  ordered (numbers) list elements.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>HTML5:</strong> This is the latest version of HTML,
              introducing new elements and capabilities (like &lt;video&gt; for
              embedding videos) and removing outdated practices.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            Imagine HTML as the skeleton of a web page. It outlines the
            structure, but it doesn't deal with the visual styling (that's what
            CSS is for) or interactive functionality (JavaScript's domain). As a
            front-end engineer, you would use HTML in combination with CSS and
            JavaScript to build and style dynamic, interactive web pages.

          <h3>5.2 &mdash; Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)</h3>

          <p>
            CSS, or Cascading Style Sheets, is a cornerstone style sheet
            language used in web development to describe the presentation of
            documents written in HTML. It empowers developers and designers to
            control the visual aesthetics of web pages, including layout,
            colors, fonts, and responsiveness to different screen sizes. Unlike
            HTML, which structures content, CSS focuses on how that content is
            displayed, enabling the separation of content and design for more
            efficient and flexible styling. The "cascading" aspect of CSS allows
            multiple style sheets to influence a single web page, with specific
            rules taking precedence over others, leading to a cohesive and
            visually engaging user experience across the web.
          </p>

          <p>
            Imagine HTML as the skeleton of a web page—it defines where the
            headers, paragraphs, images, and other elements go. CSS is like the
            clothing and makeup—it determines how these elements look. Here's a
            breakdown:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Selectors and Properties</strong>: In CSS, you write
              "rules" that target HTML elements. These rules specify how the
              elements should be styled. A CSS rule consists of a "selector"
              (which targets the HTML element) and a "property" (which styles
              it). For example, you can have a rule that targets all &lt;p&gt;
              (paragraph) elements and sets their text color to red.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Cascading and Specificity:</strong> Styles are applied in
              order of specificity, with inline styles being the most specific,
              followed by ID, class, and tag selectors.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Box Model</strong>: Everything in CSS is considered as a
              box, with properties like padding, borders, and margins. These
              properties define the space around and within each element,
              affecting layout and spacing.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>External, Internal, and Inline:</strong> CSS can be
              included externally in a .css file, internally in the HTML head,
              or inline within HTML elements.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Responsive Design</strong>: CSS allows you to make web
              pages look good on different devices and screen sizes. This is
              often done using "media queries," which apply different styles
              based on the device's characteristics, like its width.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Animation and Interaction</strong>: CSS isn't just about
              static styles. You can create animations, transitions, and hover
              effects, enhancing the interactivity and visual appeal of your web
              page.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            Understanding CSS involves getting familiar with its syntax and
            rules, and then applying them to create visually appealing and
            functional web pages. As a front-end engineer, you'd often work
            closely with CSS, alongside HTML and JavaScript, to create the
            user-facing part of websites and applications.

          <h3>5.4 &mdash; Document Object Model (DOM)</h3>

          <p>
            The Document Object Model (DOM) is a fundamental programming
            interface for web documents that conceptualizes a webpage as a
            hierarchical tree of nodes, enabling dynamic interaction and
            manipulation. This model transforms each HTML element, attribute,
            and text snippet into an accessible object, allowing programming
            languages, particularly JavaScript, to effectively alter the page's
            structure, style, and content. The DOM's tree-like structure not
            only simplifies navigating and editing web documents but also
            facilitates real-time updates, event handling, and interaction,
            making it indispensable for creating responsive and interactive web
            applications.
          </p>

          <p>Key Features:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Tree Structure:</strong> The DOM represents a web page as
              a tree, with elements, attributes, and text as nodes. An HTML
              document, for example, is a tree that includes nodes like
              <code>&lt;html&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;head&gt;</code>, and
              <code>&lt;body&gt;</code>.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Manipulation:</strong> Programming languages, especially
              JavaScript, can manipulate the DOM. This allows for changes in
              HTML elements, attributes, and text, as well as adding or removing
              elements.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Event Handling:</strong> The DOM handles events caused by
              user interactions or browser activities. It allows scripts to
              respond to these events through event handlers.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Dynamic Changes:</strong> With the DOM, web pages can
              dynamically change content and structure without needing to
              reload, enabling interactive and dynamic web applications.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h3>5.5 &mdash; Programming Languages that Compile to JavaScript</h3>

            into standard JavaScript, compatible with all JavaScript
            environments.
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Static Typing (TypeScript Example):</strong> TypeScript
              adds static typing, meaning variables and functions have defined
              types checked at compile-time, reducing errors.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Compilation to JavaScript:</strong> These languages are
              compiled into standard JavaScript, making them understandable and
              executable in any browser or JavaScript environment.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Enhanced Features and Syntax:</strong> They offer features
              not present in standard JavaScript and may have different syntax
              to simplify complex operations.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Tooling and Ecosystem:</strong> These languages are
              supported by advanced tooling for debugging and testing, along

          <h3>5.9 &mdash; Node.js &#38; NPM</h3>
          <p>
            Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform JavaScript runtime
            environment that enables JavaScript to run on the server side,
            extending its capabilities beyond web browsers. It operates on an
            event-driven, non-blocking I/O model, making it efficient for
            data-intensive real-time applications that run across distributed
            devices.
          </p>

          <p>
            Beyond its use in server-side development, Node.js also serves as a
            powerful tool in command line environments for various development
            tasks, such as running build processes, automating tasks, and
            managing project dependencies. Its integration with NPM (Node
            Package Manager) provides access to a vast repository of libraries
            and tools, enhancing its utility in the development ecosystem. This
            dual functionality as both a server framework and a command-line
            tool makes Node.js a versatile platform in the realm of web
            development.
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Runtime Environment:</strong> It provides a platform to
              execute JavaScript on servers and various back-end applications.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Non-blocking I/O:</strong> Node.js operates on an
              event-driven, non-blocking I/O model, enabling efficient handling
              of multiple operations simultaneously.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Use of JavaScript:</strong> It leverages JavaScript,
              allowing for consistent language use across both client-side and
              server-side scripts.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>NPM (Node Package Manager):</strong> Comes with a vast
              library ecosystem through NPM, facilitating the development of
              complex applications.
