          <h2>1. Overview</h2>
          <h3>1.1 &mdash; What is a (Frontend||UI||UX) Developer/Engineer?</h3>
          <p>
            A front-end developer/engineer uses Web Platform
            Technologies&mdash;namely HTML, CSS, and JavaScript&mdash; to
            produce a front-end (i.e., a user interface with which the user
            interacts) for websites, web applications, and native applications.
          </p>

          <p>
            Most practitioners are introduced to the occupation after creating
            their first HTML web page. The most straightforward work output from
            a front-end developer/engineer is an HTML document that runs in a
            web browser, producing a web page.
          </p>

          <h4>Additional Outputs:</h4>

          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>
                <strong>Websites</strong> - A website is a collection of
                interlinked web pages and associated multimedia content
                accessible over the Internet. Typically identified by a unique
                domain name, a website is hosted on web servers and can be
                accessed by users through a web browser. Websites serve various
                functions ranging from simple static web pages to complex
                dynamic web pages.

              <p>
                <strong>The front-end of a Web Application</strong> - Unlike
                native applications installed on a device, web applications are
                delivered to users through a web browser. They often interact
                with databases to store, retrieve, and manipulate data. Because
                web applications run in a browser, they are generally
                cross-platform and can be accessed on various devices, including
                desktops, laptops, tablets, and smartphones.
              </p>
            </li>

                  >The front-end of a Native Application (from Web Platform
                  Technologies)</strong
                >
                - These applications are built from web technologies and
                typically use native APIs and device features like those made
                with traditional native development frameworks (e.g., file
                system API). This type of development can be accomplished using
                an embedded webview (e.g., Tauri), browser engine (e.g.,
                Electron), or be as complex as compiling web technologies
                directly into native application code (e.g., React Native,
                NativeScript, Flutter, etc.).

          <p>
            Web Game Development involves creating interactive and engaging
            games that run directly in web browsers. This area of focus is
            distinct from traditional game development primarily due to the
            technologies used and the platform (web browsers) on which the games
            are deployed.
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Technologies and Tools -</strong> Web game developers
              often use HTML5, CSS, and JavaScript as the core technologies.
              HTML5 allows for more interactive and media-rich content,
              essential for game development. JavaScript is used for game logic
              and dynamics, and WebGL is employed for 2D and 3D graphics
              rendering.
            </li>

            <li>
              <strong>Frameworks and Libraries -</strong> Several
              JavaScript-based game engines and frameworks facilitate web game
              development. Examples include Phaser for general purposes,
              Three.js for 3D games, and Pixi.js for 2D games.
            </li>

            <li>
              <strong>Game Design -</strong> Web game development involves game
              design elements like storyline creation, character design, level
              design, and gameplay mechanics. The developer needs to create an
              engaging user experience within the constraints of a web browser.
            </li>

            <li>
              <strong>Performance Considerations -</strong> Developers must
              optimize games for performance, ensuring quick loading, smooth
              operation, and responsiveness. Techniques include using
              spritesheet animations and minimizing heavy assets.
            </li>

            <li>
              <strong>Cross-Platform and Responsive Design -</strong> Games must
              work well across different browsers and devices, requiring a
              responsive design approach and thorough testing on various
              platforms.
            </li>

            <li>
              <strong>Monetization and Distribution -</strong> Web games can be
              monetized through in-game purchases, advertisements, or direct
              sales. They are accessible directly through a web browser without
              downloads or installations.
            </li>

            <li>
              <strong>Community and Support -</strong> The web game development
              community is vibrant, with numerous forums, tutorials, and
              resources available for developers at all levels.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            Web game development, as an area of focus in front-end development,
            combines creativity in game design with technical skills in web
            technologies, offering a unique and exciting field for developers
            interested in both gaming and web development.
