_Sponsored by [Frontend Masters](https://frontendmasters.com/), advancing your skills with in-depth, modern front-end engineering courses_

This guide serves as a comprehensive resource for those both inside and outside the field, as well as those aspiring to join the profession of front-end development. It provides a broad overview of the practice of front-end engineering, offering insights into how to learn the craft and what tools are essential for practicing it effectively in 2024.

Written with a primary focus on serving as a professional resource, this handbook aims to equip both aspiring and currently practicing front-end developers with valuable learning materials and development tools. In addition, it serves as a secondary resource for managers, CTOs, instructors, and recruiters looking to gain deeper insights into the practice of front-end development.

The content emphasizes web technologies such as HTML, CSS, DOM, and JavaScript, along with solutions that are directly built upon these open technologies. Materials referenced and discussed in the book are carefully selected to represent either the best in class or the most current solutions to various challenges.

While the book is not meant to be an exhaustive outline of all resources available to front-end developers, its value lies in its concise, focused, and timely curation of information. The aim is to provide just enough knowledge in each category to avoid overwhelming the reader on any specific subject.

Updates to the content will be made as needed to ensure its continued relevance and utility.
